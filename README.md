Details in this template were created fabricated for the sake of example only. This document provides no information about the exam beyond what is included in the official [OSCP Guide](https://support.offensive-security.com/oscp-exam-guide/). 

Additionnaly, any user should verify it against the requisites of the exam before using it. Requirements may change, I may have missed something or there might be some overkill sections. So it is better to just tweak it to your vision!

## Overview
This document serves as a template for the real report; it provides organized presentation so you can focus on pwning boxes. Please read the [OSCP Exam Guide](https://support.offensive-security.com/oscp-exam-guide/) thoroughly for the composition of your report. Good luck and try hard!

Note that details in this template have been fabricated for purposes of example. This document gives no information about the exam that is not included in the Guide.

Check out ./maindocument.pdf to see what this template looks like.

## Guide

`TODO:`: This section will be fleshed out as I tweak the template.

To create sections about more boxes, duplicate ./hosts/example, change name variables accordingly, and input the folder's host.tex file in *maindocument.tex* in the 'BOX_RUNDOWNS' section.
